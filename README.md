# 2D and 3D Computer Vision Library

A comprehensive Python library that aims to consolidate various 2D and 3D computer vision frameworks into a unified, easy-to-use interface.

## Work in Progress

This project is currently under active development. The goal is to create a centralized library that brings together the best tools and techniques from the computer vision ecosystem, making it easier for developers and researchers to work with both 2D and 3D vision tasks.

## Project Vision

The main objective of this library is to:

- **Unify frameworks**: Integrate popular computer vision libraries (OpenCV, PIL, scikit-image, Open3D, etc.) under a consistent API
- **Simplify workflows**: Provide streamlined interfaces for common 2D and 3D vision tasks
- **Bridge dimensions**: Facilitate seamless transitions between 2D and 3D computer vision workflows
- **Enhance productivity**: Reduce boilerplate code and learning curves for vision applications
